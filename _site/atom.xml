    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On March 12, 2012, Derek Eder, on behalf of &lt;a href=&quot;http://opencityapps.org&quot;&gt;Open City&lt;/a&gt;, gave testimony at a public hearing to Mayor Rahm Emanuel&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://webapps.cityofchicago.org/EthicsTaskForce/forums/list.page&quot;&gt;Ethics Reform Task Force&lt;/a&gt;. The goal was to promote open data and open government, as well as to offer two specific recommendations that the City of Chicago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;pass an open government ordinance to ensure the continued release of open data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;improve the reporting requirements for registered lobbyists by collecting more detailed, timely, and complete data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the full transcript of the testimony:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Derek Eder and I am a co-founder of Open City (&lt;a href=&quot;http://opencityapps.org&quot;&gt;opencityapps.org&lt;/a&gt;), a group of volunteer entrepreneurs who create “civic web apps” that aim to improve transparency, efficiency, and decision-making in Chicago, Cook County, and the State of Illinois. I’d like to thank Illinois Campaign for Political Reform for informing us of this task force and encouraging us to testify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, many of us have been advocating for government bodies to open up their data. In Chicago and Cook County, this is happening at a good pace now, with new administrations that have put in place open data policies and appointed technical leadership that understand and support them. (City of Chicago data can be viewed and downloaded at &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.cityofchicago.org&quot;&gt;data.cityofchicago.org&lt;/a&gt;. County data is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov&quot;&gt;datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this body, Open City would like to focus on the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Principals and benefits of open data policies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Suggestions for improving Chicago’s lobbyist data and reporting requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The principals and benefits of open data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open City subscribes to the &lt;em&gt;Eight principles of Open Government&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://public.resource.org/8_principles.html&quot;&gt;https://public.resource.org/8_principles.html&lt;/a&gt;) which include that data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;be as complete as possible&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;is not changed in significant ways after collection&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;be made available in a timely manner&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;be provided in machine readable, normalized formats&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;be offered to anyone without discrimination&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;be non-proprietary (as in no entity has exclusive control)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;be license free (at no cost and with no restrictions for use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We support reasonable privacy-related changes such as the removal of social security and bank account numbers from court data or removing data from medical records that could allow insurance companies or employers, for instance, to identify individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are a few obvious, and not so obvious, ways in which open government data policies are useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Improving transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The reason usually cited for opening up government data is to reduce graft and corruption. Lobbying data is a good example, for which we created ChicagoLobbyists.org. This web app displays, in easy to understand ways, all data related to lobbying that the City of Chicago has made available in accordance with the most recent lobbying ordinance. (A more detailed discussion of this ordinance and lobbying data is included at the end of this testimony.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. Harnessing the talent of civically-minded entrepreneurs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Independent groups such as Open City wish to contribute ideas and apps in order to inform citizens and improve the city and county in many ways. Having access to open government data makes this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few additional examples of what we have done with open data, along with a few ideas on how they could be improved if more data were to be released:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vacant Building Finder&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://chicagobuildings.org&quot;&gt;chicagobuildings.org&lt;/a&gt;) which plots vacant and abandoned buildings as reported through the city’s 311 system, based on data released by the city. We hope to expand this project to support the new city and county abandoned building ordinances by showing which properties are in foreclosure and which banks service them. This will require the Clerk of the Court of Cook County to make foreclosure filing data freely available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear Streets&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clearstreets.org&quot;&gt;clearstreets.org&lt;/a&gt;) uses locational positions of plows that the city uses for their Plow Tracker website (which shows where snow plows are at any given time) and shows which streets have been plowed and when. Currently, the data for plow locations is only available during an actual snow storm. Getting access to data from past storms would allow us to improve our accuracy and start looking into predictive models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicago Public School Tiers&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cpstiers.opencityappls.org&quot;&gt;cpstiers.opencityappls.org&lt;/a&gt;) is a tool that helps Chicago Public Schools (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CPS&lt;/span&gt;) students and parents find what socio-economic tier they live in, which effects their chances of getting in to a selective school. The data for this was released in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; documents, and our group had to manually extract the data and line it up with census tracts. Many other useful apps for students and parents could be created if &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CPS&lt;/span&gt; released more of it’s data and provided it in a machine readable format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other groups, individuals, and companies are working with public data in a wide variety of ways. Many of these can be viewed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://appsformetrochicago.com&quot;&gt;appsformetrochicago.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;III&lt;/span&gt;. Improving efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the public sphere, using data to improve efficiency of government services is rapidly gaining traction. Some examples of current or projected uses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The City’s Plow Tracker and Open City’s ClearStreets in the example cited above helps citizens make informed decisions about how to move throughout the city during, or after, a snow storm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Analyzing &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; tracking of public vehicles could help plan more efficient routes, for example, to reduce cost of garbage collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In public transportation, opening up &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CTA&lt;/span&gt; data has resulted in many useful train- and bus-tracking apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Making it easier for city departments to coordinate activities such as tree trimming, pothole repair, sewer work, and street resurfacing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the City of Chicago to continue leading in open data, it must continue to release this highly valuable data in accordance with the above stated Eight principles of Open Government, and must do everything it can to ensure that future administrations do so as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the City is required to comply with the Freedom of Information Act for responding to requests for data, there is currently no ordinance in the books that requires the City to release data on the data portal (data.cityofchicago.org). This administration, or future ones could, at any point, cease releasing this data should it be politically expedient to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our opinion that the City of Chicago should take steps in passing an open government ordinance, similar to the one passed today in New York City (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/policy/232602252&quot;&gt;http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/policy/232602252&lt;/a&gt;) and by Cook County in September 2011 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cookcountygov.com/opencc/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Open_Cook_County_9.21.11.pdf&quot;&gt;http://blog.cookcountygov.com/opencc/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Open_Cook_County_9.21.11.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Suggestions to improve Chicago’s lobbyist data and reporting requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open City has gained some expertise in this area, as we learned much about lobbying data while building ChicagoLobbyists.org and from discussions with the San Francisco Ethics Commission. We believe that San Francisco’s lobbying ordinance sets a great example for Chicago to follow and improve upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The San Francisco ordinance can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfethics.org/ethics/2009/12/lobbyist-ordinance-2010.html&quot;&gt;http://www.sfethics.org/ethics/2009/12/lobbyist-ordinance-2010.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Chicago ordinance can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/ethics/supp_info/governmental_ethicsordinance.html#2-156-210&quot;&gt;http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/ethics/supp_info/governmental_ethicsordinance.html#2-156-210&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the recent ordinance passed in Chicago in July 2011 is a significant step in the right direction, we feel that lobbyist transparency can still be improved in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Require all interactions be reported in a timely manner. Currently, lobbyists in Chicago are required to report quarterly. In San Francisco, they are required to report monthly. Waiting up to three months for this data to be gathered impedes transparency. Weekly or daily reports would be ideal, so that lobbying efforts can be tied more easily to specific legislation or administrative decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Require more detail about lobbying activities, including the name(s) of city officials lobbied, what was discussed, and when. Currently, entities lobbied are listed under their department name only (“Mayor’s Office,” “Dept of Transportation,” “Department of Police”, etc.). Issues discussed are often described with one to three words, such as “Procurement matters,” “PD”, “TIF”, or “Community Interface”. There is no date associated with any lobbying action, except for the year. City official names, detailed descriptions, and dates of interactions should be required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add a requirement that employees, officers, or directors of non-profits seeking to influence legislative or administrative actions related to their non-profit entity be required to report as any other lobbyist. We believe that anyone who lobbies as part of his or her paid employment should be defined as a lobbyist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open City believes that cities should work together to adopt a common approach to specifying lobbyist filing and reporting requirements, so that very similar software can be used across all municipalities. This would save local governments time and money and promote a general attitude of openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, it is our recommendation that the City of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;pass an open government ordinance to ensure the continued release of open data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;improve the reporting requirements for registered lobbyists by collecting more detailed, timely, and complete data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for hearing our testimony.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Chicago ain’t ready for procurement reform - Despite changes, the city continues to shut out tech innovators</title>
    <updated>2012-01-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Chicago Lobbyists</name>
      <uri>http://blog.chicagolobbyists.org/</uri>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class='r'&gt;&lt;a href='/docs/RFPdeclined.pdf'&gt;&lt;img src='/images/Proposal_Declined.png' alt='Proposal Declined' title='Proposal Declined' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 12, 2012 – We recently received a &lt;a href='/docs/RFPdeclined.pdf'&gt;rejection letter&lt;/a&gt; from the City of Chicago regarding our &lt;a href='/2011/12/15/our-response-to-chicagos-lobbyist-rfp/'&gt;bid&lt;/a&gt; to build them an online lobbyist registration app. &lt;a href='http://www.crowehorwath.com/'&gt;Crowe Horwath &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LLP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an accounting and consulting firm based in Oak Brook, lllinois, won the bid instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were almost certainly rejected because we did not fulfill the &lt;a href='/docs/Spec101998.pdf'&gt;application requirements&lt;/a&gt; set out by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dps.html&quot;&gt;Department of Procurement Services&lt;/a&gt;. We never intended to. Despite being very competent technologists and experts on lobbying data, we simply couldn’t meet them: The city’s requirements are not crafted with tech startups in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Mayor Emanuel’s pledge to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/supp_info/chicago_2011_transition_report.pdf&quot;&gt;promote entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;, his moves to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2011/may_2011/Mayor_elect_Emanuel_Names_Chicagos_Technology_Leadership_Team.html&quot;&gt;modernize the city’s technology&lt;/a&gt;, and his promise that last year’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wttw.com/moreonthestory/2011/07/21/mayor-emanuel-announces-reforms-in-city-contracting/&quot;&gt;city contracting reforms&lt;/a&gt; would “ensure competitive, accountable and open bidding,” high barriers to entry that protect entrenched incumbents and shut out innovative startups are still very much in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In private industry, many organizations have adapted their procurement process to suit modern website development,” says Paul Baker, the co-founder and president of Webitects, a web design firm. “The city still treats it like you’re pouring 60,000 tons of concrete, like you’re building a bridge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart organizations judge you based on your track record and the quality of your (proposed) solutions to their problems. The city, on the other hand, focuses on requirements: of the 152-page &lt;a href='/docs/Spec101998.pdf'&gt;request for proposal&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt;) the city issued for the lobbyists app, only 10 pages touch on actual applications specs (p. 87 &amp;#8211; 97.) The rest is largely forms and legalese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because the city is more concerned with minimizing the risk of project failure than with seeking out ideas and ability. Though the intent is no doubt to protect taxpayers, the results are perverse: innovators are shut out, city IT is stuck in the stone age, city workers and citizens lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the firm the city chose to build the lobbyist system: Crowe Horath is the same company that built the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en.html&quot;&gt;City of Chicago’s current website&lt;/a&gt;. The city paid them &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2010/03/city-of-chicago-unveils-redesigned-web-site.html&quot;&gt;$1.8 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 to carry out the city’s first website redesign in 9 years. This company also built the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.explorechicago.org/city/en.html&quot;&gt;Explore Chicago&lt;/a&gt; tourism website, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crowehorwath.com/ContentDetails.aspx?id=1321&quot;&gt;applied the same design&lt;/a&gt; to the City of Chicago site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an &lt;a href='http://www.meetup.com/OpenGovChicago/events/38655692/'&gt;OpenGov Chicago meet up&lt;/a&gt; in November, the group discussed the City&amp;#8217;s website. Some people &lt;a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/OpenGovChicago#!topic/opengovchicago/Zr284xOnARU'&gt;raised usability issues, and several suggestions for improvement were made&lt;/a&gt;. The city seems to recognize that there are issues with the site, since they are looking to redesign it again after being in use for less than two years. (&lt;em&gt;Note: I am a co-organizer of OpenGov Chicago, but this blog post is my own opinion and not a statement on behalf of the group&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question now is, with Mayor Emanuel touting innovation and change, why is it still business as usual when it comes doling out taxpayer dollars for the projects that really matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe technology can help transform government at the core. But Government 2.0 will never become a reality without real procurement reform to level the playing field for innovative newcomers. In other words, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/procurement-is-americas-big-problem&quot;&gt;procurement is the problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we want to be part of the solution. We’re announcing the creation of a nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/12/2011-gov2-year-in-review.html#civic-startups&quot;&gt;civic startup&lt;/a&gt;: an open gov, open-source development shop that will not just build apps on open data, but also compete to build re-usable software that transforms how government does business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on this to come soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Dec 28, 2011 &amp;#8211; On December 20, &lt;a href='http://govfresh.com/'&gt;GovFresh&lt;/a&gt; announced the &lt;a href='http://govfresh.com/2011/12/2011-govfresh-awards-winners/'&gt;winners of the 2011 GovFresh Awards&lt;/a&gt;. The website aims to encourage government-citizen collaboration in order to &amp;#8220;build a more engaged democracy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='clear'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago Lobbyists placed first as &amp;#8220;Best use of open source&amp;#8221; and the city of Chicago placed second to New York City as &lt;a href='http://govfresh.com/2011/12/2011-govfresh-city-of-the-year-new-york-city/'&gt;City of the Year&lt;/a&gt;. New York was cited for its Engage &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; initiative, aimed at getting designers and developers civically active, and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; Open Data, a repository of more than 850 city datasets, including public school data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were happy to see tweets from &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/ChicagosMayor/status/149194960275636224'&gt;Mayor Emmanuel&amp;#8217;s office&lt;/a&gt;, city &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/ChicagoCDO/status/149197667820503040'&gt;Chicago &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDO&lt;/span&gt; Brett Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/PoliticalEditor/status/149191489426169856'&gt;Mike Flannery&lt;/a&gt; at Fox News and OpenGov activist &lt;a href=''&gt;Steve Vance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also happy to see Chicago Lobbyists being used by journalists for online research, as in this New York Times &lt;a href='http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/the-trouble-with-that-revolving-door/'&gt;article on lobbying&lt;/a&gt;. See the link to lobbying firm &lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/firms/dla-piper-rudnick-gray-cary'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DLA&lt;/span&gt; Piper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GovFresh also highlights five Cook County open data visualizations based on the county&amp;#8217;s new &lt;a href='http://govfresh.com/2011/12/five-open-data-visualizations-from-cook-county-il/'&gt;Socrata open data catalog&lt;/a&gt;, including Public facilities and services, top sheriff&amp;#8217;s violations, outpatient registrations, mortgages, and elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Our Response to Chicago's RFP for a Lobbyist Registration System</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Derek Eder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec 15, 2011 &amp;#8211; The City of Chicago put out a &lt;a href='/docs/Spec101998.pdf'&gt;Request for Proposals (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; to create an online lobbyist registration system. This &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt; stems directly from an &lt;a href='http://blogs.wttw.com/moreonthestory/2011/07/28/city-council-passes-ethics-reform-ordinance/'&gt;ethics ordinance&lt;/a&gt; passed on July 28th 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/docs/Spec101998.pdf'&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid #ccc; &quot; src='/images/RFP-cover.png' alt='City of Chicago Lobbyist Disclosure System RFP' title='City of Chicago Lobbyist Disclosure System RFP' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RFP&amp;#8217;s objectives are for an outside contractor to build a system that will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;enable lobbyists registered with the City to file, on line, all required registration documents and activity reports.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;enable the Department to review and approve these filings as quickly as possible and communicate with lobbyists who must and have not completed their filing requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;make data compiled from all lobbyists&amp;#8217; filings publicly available on line in various searchable, queriable reporting formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the work we have already done, and our goal to help bring openness and transparency to the City of Chicago, the people who created Chicago Lobbyists have decided to respond to this &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt; for the City of Chicago is a herculean task. In the 152 pages, in addition to the usual cover letter, cost proposal, timeframe, etc, the responder must provide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a project management/implementation plan (including org chart, all software and third party products used, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;audited financial statements for the past 3 years&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;an economic disclosure statement and affidavit (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;EDS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;proof of $500k workers compensation and employers liability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;proof $2 million in professional liability insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this approach to an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt; results in proposals from one type of contractor: firms that are very large and able to jump through all the hoops that the City has to ensure the minimum amount of risk and liability for the City itself. The idea is, if they remove all apparent risk in the selection process, no one will be to blame if the project fails since they vetted the options so thoroughly. What the contractor actually builds and how they plan on going about it is completely secondary. This type of process rarely provides high quality products at a reasonable price, especially in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a group of volunteers working in our free time on this project, we are not what this &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt; is targeting. We are, however, very competent developers and designers and have become experts on this lobbying data and how to display it. If the third objective of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt; (above) sounds familiar to you, that&amp;#8217;s because you&amp;#8217;ve been to &lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org'&gt;ChicagoLobbyists.org&lt;/a&gt;. We have already met objective 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our proposal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not being able to fulfill most of the requirements of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt;, we went ahead and responded anyway. We expect the city to pick one of their usual contractors, but hope that they will consider us as additional consultants for the design and front end development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href='/docs/ChicagoLobbyistsProposal.pdf'&gt;Download our proposal&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/docs/ChicagoLobbyistsProposal.pdf'&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid #ccc; &quot; src='/images/RFP-response-packet.jpg' alt='Chicago Lobbyists RFP response' title='Chicago Lobbyists RFP response' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proposal, besides showcasing the work we have already done, we offer to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Design research, initially involving interviews with lobbyists entering the data, with the public that views data visualizations, and with city personnel charged with carrying out the ordinance&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;User interface design and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Usability testing&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Web strategy&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Adapting ChicagoLobbyist.org design and code under a new city-controlled &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to fulfill the public facing website requirement&lt;/li&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;Creating an interoperable &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for exporting data in a normalized format&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also advocate releasing as much code and design as possible as open source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We suggest that, whenever possible, the code, data schemas, and designs should be released as open source. Chicago has a unique opportunity to set an open standard for lobbying data structure, collection, and display—so other municipalities can use it. This will also set a good example for government-related projects that it makes sense to share.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moving from proprietary systems to open source makes collaboration and sharing easier and gives access to a wider pool of highly skilled talent. Examples of successful projects include Open 311, which the city plans to implement in 2012, and Open Street Maps, a viable alternative to Google and Bing Maps.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have more updates the next few days.

    <title>Chicago Lobbyists Version 2 Is Here</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;by Derek Eder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec 2, 2011 &amp;#8211; We just rolled out a new version of Chicago Lobbyists last night. Thanks to our meetings with Chicago &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/ChicagoCDO'&gt;Brett Goldstein&lt;/a&gt; and the efforts from his staff, we now have the ability to show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What clients paid to each lobbyist (and how much)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Which actions clients hired lobbyists to take&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How much money each client spent (total) on lobbyists in 2010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new data also seems to have been cleaned up and normalized quite a bit (we still had to do some normalizing ourselves &amp;#8211; especially with addresses), resulting in a more accurate picture of lobbying activity in Chicago for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a rundown of the new features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/clients'&gt;Most active clients&lt;/a&gt; is now determined by amount spent instead of number of lobbyists hired (&lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/clients/salvation-army'&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;, you are now #1 with $380,000 spent on lobbyists in 2010)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/clients'&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid #ccc; &quot; src='/images/v2-client-list.png' alt='New client listing' title='New client listing' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All detail pages have a summary section at the top, displaying total amounts, number of lobbyists, number of clients, number of firms, and number of actions (depending on what you&amp;#8217;re viewing). Here&amp;#8217;s an example of each:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Lobbyist &amp;#8211; &lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/lobbyists/ronald-johnson'&gt;Ronald Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Firm &amp;#8211; &lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/firms/neal-and-leroy-llc'&gt;Neal &amp;amp; Leroy, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LLC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Client &amp;#8211; &lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/clients/fifth-third-bank'&gt;Fifth Third Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Agency &amp;#8211; &lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/agencies/city-council'&gt;City Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/lobbyists/ronald-johnson'&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid #ccc; &quot; src='/images/v2-lobbyist-detail.png' alt='Lobbyist detail - Ronald Johnson' title='Lobbyist detail - Ronald Johnson' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global site search (using &lt;a href='http://www.google.com/cse/'&gt;Google custom search engine&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every lobbyist action has a client associated with it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every lobbyist payment shows the client who paid them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categorized lobbyist expenditures (office expenses, food, travel, education, etc) are now listed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cross referenced the City of Chicago &lt;a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Payments/s4vu-giwb'&gt;Payments database&lt;/a&gt;, and listed all payments by Chicago to each client (example: &lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/clients/christy-webber-landscapes'&gt;Christy Webber Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/clients/christy-webber-landscapes'&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid #ccc; &quot; src='/images/v2-city-payments.png' alt='Christy Webber Landscapes - City Payments' title='Christy Webber Landscapes - City Payments' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All detail pages now have tabs for each section so you can see all the rich data, without cluttering the page&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All data on the detail pages is sortable and searchable (thanks to jQuery &lt;a href='http://datatables.net/'&gt;Datatables&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All detail pages have comments (powered by &lt;a href='http://disqus.com/dashboard/'&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re all really excited about these new updates. We now have the most accurate and detailed visualization of lobbyist activities around. That&amp;#8217;s something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>An Open Data Story</title>

&lt;p&gt;Dec 1, 2011 &amp;#8211; In almost all open data projects, providing raw data is not enough. And it’s not enough to be a good programmer or designer. To be useful, we need to be able to figure out what questions the data might reveal and which of these might be useful for the public to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class='r'&gt;&lt;a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/Ethics/Lobbyist-Data-2010-Lobbyist-Registry/2ft4-4uik'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/images/city-data-portal.png' alt='Lobbyist Data - 2010 Lobbyist Registry' title='Lobbyist Data - 2010 Lobbyist Registry' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early July 2011, the City of Chicago released &lt;a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?tags=lobbyists'&gt;14 sets of lobbying-related data&lt;/a&gt;, including lobbyists, lobbying agencies, gifts to city employees, expenditures, clients of lobbyists, etc. However, an ordinary human being could not make heads or tails of this without some sort of integration. &lt;br /&gt;
That’s why we built &lt;a href='http://www.chicagoLobbyists.org'&gt;ChicagoLobbyists.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='clear'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chicago Lobbyists v1.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we went through each data set, attempting to draw relationships among them by looking for common fields such as clients, lobbying firms, and individual lobbyists. Our goal was to reveal answers to questions such as, &amp;#8220;WalMart paid which lobbyist, with which lobbying firm, how much money, to argue on their behalf in front of which department or committee, and for what purpose?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon found out that we couldn’t answer that question. In the above example, we could show which lobbyists Walmart paid, which firm the lobbyist worked for, and which city agencies the lobbyist appeared before, but not which tasks lobbyists were hired to do for WalMart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting with the City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the July Google hackathon, at which we built and launched the site, we met with the city’s Chief Data Officer, &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/ChicagoCDO'&gt;Brett Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;, and some IT staff, and asked: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to determine compensation that comes to a firm versus lobbyist? (We can’t be sure adding up compensation of all lobbyists within a firm is accurate.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to determine how much a client paid to a lobbying firm or lobbyist?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Related to the question above, can we retrieve the purpose for a client payment?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Can we receive data before 2010? If so, what years are available?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to determine which client requested an action in front of an agency? We only know which lobbyist requested an action—see example: &lt;a href='http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/lobbyists/theodore-brunsvold'&gt;Theodore Brunsvold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are street addresses available for lobbying firms (some give political donations from many different addresses)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do you have a good state contact from which we could request political donation data?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is there a list of all city datasets available (besides those on Socrata)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is there a schedule of when particular datasets are updated (frequency, time period)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The City responds with updated data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late August, Brett’s team had collected and &lt;a href='http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2011/august_2011/mayor_emanuel_announcesnewlobbyistdatathatprovidesclearconnectio.html'&gt;posted the data that we had requested&lt;/a&gt;. Now, we are able to incorporate the new data and change the site’s design to show more detailed and new views (&lt;strong&gt;these changes are coming in the next day or so &amp;#8211; stay tuned&lt;/strong&gt;). Now we can answer most of the important questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next steps &amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next steps are to incorporate political donations to city officials by lobbyists and organizations. It would also be good to show how elected officials voted on issues of interest to lobbyists who have donated to them and their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire &lt;a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2012-Budget-Recommendations-Appropriations/8dps-5d4x'&gt;2012 city budget&lt;/a&gt; is about $3 billion—all of it paid by residents. Fees paid to lobbyists to influence government decisions will probably be in the neighborhood of $13 million, or about .4% of $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re the 99.6%. Lobbyists paid by organizations are .4%. Are lobbyists the tail that wags the dog?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Aug 19, 2011 &amp;#8211; Ryan Briones and Chad Pry &lt;a href='http://www.meetup.com/OpenGovChicago/events/28864281/'&gt;gave a presentation to the OpenGov Chicago meetup&lt;/a&gt; on the origin and future of ChicagoLobbyists.org. Below are the meeting notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Origins&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Started with an existing Obtiva/Webitects relationship. Paul, Ryan, Chad and Derek were all interested in doing an opendata project. The Google Hack-a-thon presented an opportunity and put on pressure for us to really build something. The lobbyist data was just released the week before and knowing about lobbyist activity is considered to be a &amp;#8216;juicy&amp;#8217; topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did we do it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the main contributors spent ~5 hours the week before the hack-a-thon cleaning up data with &lt;a href='http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/'&gt;Google Refine&lt;/a&gt;, eyeballing obvious relationships in the data, doing some base &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; layouts and setting up a host for the application (Ruby/Sinatra). At the Google Open Data Hack-a-thon 6 people worked on the project: the 4 originators plus Ruthie and Chirag. By the end of the day we had a basic structure and database set up. The following weeks, we worked in our spare time and now have a minimum viable product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is in the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add more meaningful data to inform you about lobbyists, clients and agencies. We have started a relationship working with Brett Goldstein (Chicago&amp;#8217;s Chief Data Officer) and the Ethics department to fill in the gaps. Once we have Chicago down, we will generalize our model for use with other cities to visualize their lobbyist data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the code is open source and can be &lt;a href='https://github.com/open-city/chicago-lobbyists-web'&gt;checked out on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;July 17, 2011 &amp;#8211; Chicago Lobbyists started as an existing relationship between civic-minded members of &lt;a href='http://obtiva.com/'&gt;Obtiva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://webitects.com'&gt;Webitects&lt;/a&gt;. In early July 2011, when Google announced it would be hosting a hackathon focused on Chicago civic data, it was a perfect excuse to bring our group together for the first time to build something great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul pointed out that the &lt;a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?tags=lobbyists'&gt;lobbyist data&lt;/a&gt; was particularly interesting. It was always a hot topic in the media and the City had just released it a few weeks prior and we all quickly agreed to focus on that for our hackathon project. The question then was, what could we do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week before the hackathon, we brainstormed over this very question and came up with the idea that it could be a &amp;#8216;Facebook for lobbyists&amp;#8217;. Each lobbyist would have a page, which would show various details about their firms, the money they were paid, and the actions they sought in front of city agencies (City Council, Department of Buildings, etc). From there, other page layouts emerged, and going in to the Saturday hackathon, the team had developed &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; templates for those very pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day of the hackathon, our group worked for 8 hours straight parsing the data, building out the Ruby/Sinatra app and developing additional pages. Along the way, they got some help from &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/patelc75'&gt;Chirag Patel&lt;/a&gt; on the database setup and &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/unruthless'&gt;Ruthie BenDor&lt;/a&gt; on the front-end development. By the end of the day, we had a partially working home page, which we presented to the other hackathon attendees (see photos below) to great fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running with that momentum, we continued to develop the site over the next few weeks. By August 3rd, we had a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVP&lt;/span&gt; (minimum viable product).&lt;/p&gt;
