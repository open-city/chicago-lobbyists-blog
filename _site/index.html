    <p>by Derek Eder</p>
<p>Dec 15, 2011 &#8211; The City of Chicago put out a <a href='/docs/Spec101998.pdf'>Request for Proposals (<span class="caps">RFP</span>)</a> to create an online lobbyist registration system. This <span class="caps">RFP</span> stems directly from an <a href='http://blogs.wttw.com/moreonthestory/2011/07/28/city-council-passes-ethics-reform-ordinance/'>ethics ordinance</a> passed on July 28th 2011.</p>
<h3>The <span class="caps">RFP</span></h3>
<p><a href='/docs/Spec101998.pdf'><img style="border: 1px solid #ccc; " src='/images/RFP-cover.png' alt='City of Chicago Lobbyist Disclosure System RFP' title='City of Chicago Lobbyist Disclosure System RFP' /></a> </p>
<p>The RFP&#8217;s objectives are for an outside contractor to build a system that will</p>
<ol>
	<li>enable lobbyists registered with the City to file, on line, all retired registration documents and activity reports.</li>
	<li>enable the Department to review and approve these filings as quickly as possible and communicate with lobbyists who must and have not completed their filing requirements.</li>
	<li>make data compiled from all lobbyists&#8217; filings publicly available on line in various searchable, queriable reporting formats.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of the work we have already done, and our goal to help bring openness and transparency to the City of Chicago, the people who created Chicago Lobbyists have decided to respond to this <span class="caps">RFP</span>.</p>
<h3>The challenge</h3>
<p>Responding to an <span class="caps">RFP</span> for the City of Chicago is a herculean task. In the 152 pages, in addition to the usual cover letter, cost proposal, timeframe, etc, the responder must provide</p>
<ul>
	<li>a project management/implementation plan (including org chart, all software and third party products used, etc)</li>
	<li>audited financial statements for the past 3 years</li>
	<li>an economic disclosure statement and affidavit (<span class="caps">EDS</span>)</li>
	<li>proof of $500k workers compensation and employers liability</li>
	<li>proof $2 million in professional liability insurance</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, this approach to an <span class="caps">RFP</span> results in proposals from one type of contractor, very large and able to jump through all the hoops that the City has to ensure the minimum amount of risk and liability for the City itself. The idea is, if they remove all apparent risk in the selection process, no one will be to blame if the project fails since they vetted the options so thoroughly. What the contractor actually builds and how they plan on going about it is completely secondary. This type of process rarely provides high quality products at a reasonable price, especially in software development.</p>
<p>As a group of volunteers working in our free time on this project, we are not what this <span class="caps">RFP</span> is targeting. We are, however, very competent developers and designers and have become experts on this lobbying data and how to display it. If the third objective of the <span class="caps">RFP</span> (above) sounds familiar to you, that&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve been to <a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org'>ChicagoLobbyists.org</a>. Objective 3 has already been met by us.</p>
<h3>Our proposal</h3>
<p>Despite not being able to fulfill most of the requirements of the <span class="caps">RFP</span>, we went ahead and responded anyway. We expect the city to pick one of their usual contractors, but hope that they will consider us as additional consultants for the design and front end development. You can <a href='/docs/ChicagoLobbyistsProposal.docx'>download our <span class="caps">RFP</span> response here</a>.</p>
<p><a href='/docs/ChicagoLobbyistsProposal.docx'><img style="border: 1px solid #ccc; " src='/images/RFP-response-packet.jpg' alt='Chicago Lobbyists RFP response' title='Chicago Lobbyists RFP response' /></a> </p>
<p>In the proposal, besides showcasing the work we have already done, we offer to do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design research, initially involving interviews with lobbyists entering the data, with the public that views data visualizations, and with city personnel charged with carrying out the ordinance</li> 
	<li>User interface design and <span class="caps">HTML</span>/<span class="caps">CSS</span></li> 
	<li>Usability testing</li> 
	<li>Web strategy</li> 
	<li>Adapting ChicagoLobbyist.org design and code under a new city-controlled <span class="caps">URL</span> to fulfill the public facing website requirement</li> 
	<li>Creating an interoperable <span class="caps">API</span> for exporting data in a normalized format</li> 
</ul>
<p>We also advocate releasing as much code and design as possible as open source:</p>
<blockquote>We suggest that, whenever possible, the code, data schemas, and designs should be released as open source. Chicago has a unique opportunity to set an open standard for lobbying data structure, collection, and display—so other municipalities can use it. This will also set a good example for government-related projects that it makes sense to share.<br />
<br />
Moving from proprietary systems to open source makes collaboration and sharing easier and gives access to a wider pool of highly skilled talent. Examples of successful projects include Open 311, which the city plans to implement in 2012, and Open Street Maps, a viable alternative to Google and Bing Maps.</blockquote>
<p>We will have more updates the next few days.</p>

    <p>by Derek Eder</p>
<p>Dec 2, 2011 &#8211; We just rolled out a new version of Chicago Lobbyists last night. Thanks to our meetings with Chicago <span class="caps">CDO</span> <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/ChicagoCDO'>Brett Goldstein</a> and the efforts from his staff, we now have the ability to show:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What clients paid to each lobbyist (and how much)</li>
	<li>Which actions clients hired lobbyists to take</li>
	<li>How much money each client spent (total) on lobbyists in 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>The new data also seems to have been cleaned up and normalized quite a bit (we still had to do some normalizing ourselves &#8211; especially with addresses), resulting in a more accurate picture of lobbying activity in Chicago for 2010.</p>
<p>Here is a rundown of the new features:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/clients'>Most active clients</a> is now determined by amount spent instead of number of lobbyists hired (<a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/clients/salvation-army'>Salvation Army</a>, you are now #1 with $380,000 spent on lobbyists in 2010)</p>
	<p><a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/clients'><img style="border: 1px solid #ccc; " src='/images/v2-client-list.png' alt='New client listing' title='New client listing' /></a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All detail pages have a summary section at the top, displaying total amounts, number of lobbyists, number of clients, number of firms, and number of actions (depending on what you&#8217;re viewing). Here&#8217;s an example of each:<br />
	<ul><br />
		<li>Lobbyist &#8211; <a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/lobbyists/ronald-johnson'>Ronald Johnson</a></li><br />
		<li>Firm &#8211; <a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/firms/neal-and-leroy-llc'>Neal &amp; Leroy, <span class="caps">LLC</span></a></li><br />
		<li>Client &#8211; <a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/clients/fifth-third-bank'>Fifth Third Bank</a></li><br />
		<li>Agency &#8211; <a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/agencies/city-council'>City Council</a></li></p>
</ul>
	<p><a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/lobbyists/ronald-johnson'><img style="border: 1px solid #ccc; " src='/images/v2-lobbyist-detail.png' alt='Lobbyist detail - Ronald Johnson' title='Lobbyist detail - Ronald Johnson' /></a> </p>
</li>
	<li><p>Global site search (using <a href='http://www.google.com/cse/'>Google custom search engine</a>)</li>
	<li><p>Every lobbyist action has a client associated with it</p></li>
	<li><p>Every lobbyist payment shows the client who paid them</li>
	<li><p>Categorized lobbyist expenditures (office expenses, food, travel, education, etc) are now listed</li>
	<li><p>We cross referenced the City of Chicago <a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Payments/s4vu-giwb'>Payments database</a>, and listed all payments by Chicago to each client (example: <a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/clients/christy-webber-landscapes'>Christy Webber Landscapes</a>)<br />
	<p><a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/clients/christy-webber-landscapes'><img style="border: 1px solid #ccc; " src='/images/v2-city-payments.png' alt='Christy Webber Landscapes - City Payments' title='Christy Webber Landscapes - City Payments' /></a> </p>
</li>
	<li><p>All detail pages now have tabs for each section so you can see all the rich data, without cluttering the page</li>
	<li><p>All data on the detail pages is sortable and searchable (thanks to jQuery <a href='http://datatables.net/'>Datatables</a>)</li>
	<li>All detail pages have comments (powered by <a href='http://disqus.com/dashboard/'>Disqus</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#8217;re all really excited about these new updates. We now have the most accurate and detailed visualization of lobbyist activities around. That&#8217;s something to be proud of.</p>

    <p>by Paul Baker</p>
<p>Dec 1, 2011 &#8211; In almost all open data projects, providing raw data is not enough. And it’s not enough to be a good programmer or designer. To be useful, we need to be able to figure out what questions the data might reveal and which of these might be useful for the public to know.</p>
<h3>The data</h3>
<p class='r'><a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/Ethics/Lobbyist-Data-2010-Lobbyist-Registry/2ft4-4uik'><img src='http://chicagolobbyists.org/images/city-data-portal.png' alt='Lobbyist Data - 2010 Lobbyist Registry' title='Lobbyist Data - 2010 Lobbyist Registry' /></a></p>
<p>In early July 2011, the City of Chicago released <a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?tags=lobbyists'>14 sets of lobbying-related data</a>, including lobbyists, lobbying agencies, gifts to city employees, expenditures, clients of lobbyists, etc. However, an ordinary human being could not make heads or tails of this without some sort of integration. <br />
That’s why we built <a href='http://chicagoLobbyists.org'>ChicagoLobbyists.org</a>.</p>
<div class='clear'></div>
<h3>Chicago Lobbyists v1.0</h3>
<p>First, we went through each data set, attempting to draw relationships among them by looking for common fields such as clients, lobbying firms, and individual lobbyists. Our goal was to reveal answers to questions such as, &#8220;WalMart paid which lobbyist, with which lobbying firm, how much money, to argue on their behalf in front of which department or committee, and for what purpose?&#8221;</p>
<p>We soon found out that we couldn’t answer that question. In the above example, we could show which lobbyists Walmart paid, which firm the lobbyist worked for, and which city agencies the lobbyist appeared before, but not which tasks lobbyists were hired to do for WalMart.</p>
<h3>Meeting with the City</h3>
<p>After the July Google hackathon, at which we built and launched the site, we met with the city’s Chief Data Officer, <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/ChicagoCDO'>Brett Goldstein</a>, and some IT staff, and asked: <br />
<ol><br />
	<li>Is there a way to determine compensation that comes to a firm versus lobbyist? (We can’t be sure adding up compensation of all lobbyists within a firm is accurate.)</li><br />
	<li>Is there a way to determine how much a client paid to a lobbying firm or lobbyist?</li><br />
	<li>Related to the question above, can we retrieve the purpose for a client payment?</li><br />
	<li>Can we receive data before 2010? If so, what years are available?</li><br />
	<li>Is there a way to determine which client requested an action in front of an agency? We only know which lobbyist requested an action—see example: <a href='http://chicagolobbyists.org/lobbyists/theodore-brunsvold'>Theodore Brunsvold</a></li><br />
	<li>Are street addresses available for lobbying firms (some give political donations from many different addresses)?</li><br />
	<li>Do you have a good state contact from which we could request political donation data?</li><br />
	<li>Is there a list of all city datasets available (besides those on Socrata)?</li><br />
	<li>Is there a schedule of when particular datasets are updated (frequency, time period)?</li></p>
</ol>
<h3>The City responds with updated data</h3>
<p>By late August, Brett’s team had collected and <a href='http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2011/august_2011/mayor_emanuel_announcesnewlobbyistdatathatprovidesclearconnectio.html'>posted the data that we had requested</a>. Now, we are able to incorporate the new data and change the site’s design to show more detailed and new views (<strong>these changes are coming in the next day or so &#8211; stay tuned</strong>). Now we can answer most of the important questions.</p>
<h3>Next steps &hellip;</h3>
<p>Our next steps are to incorporate political donations to city officials by lobbyists and organizations. It would also be good to show how elected officials voted on issues of interest to lobbyists who have donated to them and their clients.</p>
<p>The entire <a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2012-Budget-Recommendations-Appropriations/8dps-5d4x'>2012 city budget</a> is about $3 billion—all of it paid by residents. Fees paid to lobbyists to influence government decisions will probably be in the neighborhood of $13 million, or about .4% of $3 billion.</p>
<p>We’re the 99.6%. Lobbyists paid by organizations are .4%. Are lobbyists the tail that wags the dog?</p>

<p>Aug 19, 2011 &#8211; Ryan Briones and Chad Pry <a href='http://www.meetup.com/OpenGovChicago/events/28864281/'>gave a presentation to the OpenGov Chicago meetup</a> on the origin and future of ChicagoLobbyists.org. Below are the meeting notes:</p>
<h3>Origins</h3> 
<p>Started with an existing Obtiva/Webitects relationship. Paul, Ryan, Chad and Derek were all interested in doing an opendata project. The Google Hack-a-thon presented an opportunity and put on pressure for us to really build something. The lobbyist data was just released the week before and knowing about lobbyist activity is considered to be a &#8216;juicy&#8217; topic.</p>
<h3>How did we do it?</h3>
<p>Each of the main contributors spent ~5 hours the week before the hack-a-thon cleaning up data with <a href='http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/'>Google Refine</a>, eyeballing obvious relationships in the data, doing some base <span class="caps">HTML</span> layouts and setting up a host for the application (Ruby/Sinatra). At the Google Open Data Hack-a-thon 6 people worked on the project: the 4 originators plus Ruthie and Chirag. By the end of the day we had a basic structure and database set up. The following weeks, we worked in our spare time and now have a minimum viable product.</p>
<h3>What is in the future?</h3>
<p>Add more meaningful data to inform you about lobbyists, clients and agencies. We have started a relationship working with Brett Goldstein (Chicago&#8217;s Chief Data Officer) and the Ethics department to fill in the gaps. Once we have Chicago down, we will generalize our model for use with other cities to visualize their lobbyist data.</p>
<p>All the code is open source and can be <a href='https://github.com/chicago-lobbyists/web'>checked out on Github</a>.</p>

<p>July 17, 2011 &#8211; Chicago Lobbyists started as an existing relationship between civic-minded members of <a href='http://obtiva.com/'>Obtiva</a> and <a href='http://webitects.com'>Webitects</a>. In early July 2011, when Google announced it would be hosting a hackathon focused on Chicago civic data, it was a perfect excuse to bring our group together for the first time to build something great.</p>
<p>Paul pointed out that the <a href='http://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?tags=lobbyists'>lobbyist data</a> was particularly interesting. It was always a hot topic in the media and the City had just released it a few weeks prior and we all quickly agreed to focus on that for our hackathon project. The question then was, what could we do with it?</p>
<p>The week before the hackathon, we brainstormed over this very question and came up with the idea that it could be a &#8216;Facebook for lobbyists&#8217;. Each lobbyist would have a page, which would show various details about their firms, the money they were paid, and the actions they sought in front of city agencies (City Council, Department of Buildings, etc). From there, other page layouts emerged, and going in to the Saturday hackathon, the team had developed <span class="caps">HTML</span> templates for those very pages.</p>
<p>The day of the hackathon, our group worked for 8 hours straight parsing the data, building out the Ruby/Sinatra app and developing additional pages. Along the way, they got some help from <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/patelc75'>Chirag Patel</a> on the database setup and <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/unruthless'>Ruthie BenDor</a> on the front-end development. By the end of the day, we had a partially working home page, which we presented to the other hackathon attendees (see photos below) to great fanfare.</p>
<p>Running with that momentum, we continued to develop the site over the next few weeks. By August 3rd, we had a <span class="caps">MVP</span> (minimum viable product).</p>
